# Attracting Contributors
As part of the Software Engineering Class, we would like to simulate how Open Source Projects start and try to attract potential contributions.

# Rules

1. Please choose a hobby or some interest that you want to build your repository
2. Make a README to announce this theme (i.e., my favourite video games or anime)
3. Attract - Go to https://github.com/NAIST-SE/AttractingContributors/discussions, post an interesting message to ask other members to add a list. See example below.
4. Please collect up to 10 hobbies or interest from other contributors. You can also discuss and talk about the hobby before you merge their Pull Request.

2. Announce the new project and try to attract other members.
3. Make 10 Pull Request contributions to other projects

# Popular Programming Language
Goal: I want contributors to help me list popular programming languages and why we like them. 

# Rule 
- 1. Please increment the count of your favorite programming languages(if it is not listed, please add it and set 1).
- 2. Please add comment why you like the language. 
  - format is <your-name>:<comment>

# List of Popular Programming Language
- C++ : 1
  - Tomoya Suzuki: it can help us to write very fast programs.
- C#: 1
  - Brian Confessor: It has the robustness of C++ but a slighly cleaner syntax
